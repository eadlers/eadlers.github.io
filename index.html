                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>Programming has quickly become one of my hobbies and I am very passionate about it. I started programming 
                        one year ago when I started my freshman year in college. Ever since then, I have learned a lot about how
                         computers function, and how we can use them in order to build amazing things.

                    <p>During the past year, I have aquired many skills which I am able to directly apply to the programs I write.
                        I learned many languages such as Python, Java, HTML and CSS (which I used to make this page) and even x86 
                        Assembly.

                    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I have always been amazed by the things people have been able to build using 
                        technology. My goal is to contribute to this innovation, by creating meaningful programs which can 
                        benefit other people.

           <div class="about-me--body">
               <p>I was born in Peru and have lived most of my life there. My hobbies are playing tennis, mountain biking, and programming, 
                   with the first being something i've done since I was 8 years old, and which I currently practice to compete at an intercollegiate level. Being a 
                   student-athlete is hard, but it is easier when you love what you're doing, and i'm enjoying every part of the process.
               </p>
               <p>I consider myself as a very outgoing person who enjoys trying new stuff, learning, and experiencing as much as possible. I like to live by
                    the phrase "seek discomfort" as I believe that the best things in life come the moment you step out of your comfort zone. For me, leaving my 
                    home country to pursue a better future was the biggest example of seeking discomfort i've ever done, and I believe that it helped me grow 
                    not only as a person but as a professional. My goal is to keep growing, learning, and ultimately apply everything i've experienced to make the 
                    world a better place.
